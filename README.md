Decision Tree : In this project, I build a Decision-Tree Classifier model to predict the safety of the car. I build two models, one with criterion gini index and another one with criterion entropy. The model yields a very good performance as indicated by the model accuracy in both the cases which was found to be 0.8021. In the model with criterion gini index, the training-set accuracy score is 0.7865 while the test-set accuracy to be 0.8021. These two values are quite comparable. So, there is no sign of overfitting. Similarly, in the model with criterion entropy, the training-set accuracy score is 0.7865 while the test-set accuracy to be 0.8021.We get the same values as in the case with criterion gini. So, there is no sign of overfitting. In both the cases, the training-set and test-set accuracy score is the same. It may happen because of small dataset. The confusion matrix and classification report yields very good model performance.
