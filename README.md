Decision Tree : In this project, I build a Decision-Tree Classifier model to predict the safety of the car. I build two models, one with criterion gini index and another one with criterion entropy. The model yields a very good performance as indicated by the model accuracy in both the cases which was found to be 0.8021. In the model with criterion gini index, the training-set accuracy score is 0.7865 while the test-set accuracy to be 0.8021. These two values are quite comparable. So, there is no sign of overfitting. Similarly, in the model with criterion entropy, the training-set accuracy score is 0.7865 while the test-set accuracy to be 0.8021.We get the same values as in the case with criterion gini. So, there is no sign of overfitting. In both the cases, the training-set and test-set accuracy score is the same. It may happen because of small dataset. The confusion matrix and classification report yields very good model performance.
Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. It is widely used for classification and regression tasks due to its robustness, accuracy, and ability to handle overfitting issues.

PROBLEM STATEMENT Predicting if the cancer diagnosis is benign or malignant based on several observations/features 30 features are used.

FB Prophet Model
FB Prophet is an open-source time series forecasting tool developed by Facebook (now Meta) that is designed to handle the following common challenges in time series forecasting: Seasonality: Repeating patterns at regular intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, yearly).
Holidays and special events: Events that cause irregular patterns (e.g., Christmas, promotions).
Missing data: Handles gaps or missing data in time series without needing to impute them.
Outliers: Automatically detects and handles outliers in the data.
Trend changes: Can model sudden shifts or changes in the underlying trend of the data.
Prophet is particularly useful when you have time series data that exhibits strong seasonal patterns and allows for easy tuning of seasonal components. It is simple to use, and even with minimal tuning, it produces reasonable forecasts.
